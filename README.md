This is a simple calculator using the CYD 2USB board ( ES32-2432S028 )
The User_setup for TFT_espi Library must be set up for your device and it uses the XPT-2046 Touchscreen library.
It is not perfect but works resonably well.
Happy coding
Her is a link to the correct display setup of TFT_User-seup required for the project
